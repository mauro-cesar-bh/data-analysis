The legal team has offices in four locations.\n\nThe legal team wants to improve how long it takes to reply to customers and close claims.\n\nThe head of the legal department wants a report on how each location differs in the time it\ntakes to close claims.\n\n[PDF Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/talent-assets.datacamp.com/Practical+-+DAA+-+Food+Claims+-+2212.pdf)","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"a5b3bc0e-b993-4ee3-bd07-825a474bd0d9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 1\nFor every column in the data:\n-  State whether the values match the description given in the table above.\n-  State the number of missing values in the column.\n-  Describe what you did to make values match the description if they did not match.","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Solution\nThe dataset contains 2000 rows and 8 columns.

With that we will be able to further understand why the time to close are similar even with unequally distributed number of claims.\n\n![image-4](image-4.png)\n\nAlso we can see those information on the summary statistics below: \n\n![image-5](image-5.png)\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
